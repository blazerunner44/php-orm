## Simple PHP ORM

This is a simple PHP ORM that I developed for my own projects. It maps a PHP object to a MySQL database table. 

## Rules
- No private data members that will be linked to the database. 


## Dependencies 
This project depends on nilportugues PHP query builder (https://github.com/nilportugues/php-sql-query-builder)
